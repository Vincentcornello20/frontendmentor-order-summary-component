## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive units (rem)
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

During this challenge, I practiced styling elements with hover states, such as buttons and interactive items. This helped me understand how to create a more dynamic user experience.

I also shifted from using fixed pixel values to responsive units like rem, which made the layout scale better across different screen sizes. This gave me a better understanding of responsive design and how to build pages that adapt more smoothly.

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to deepen my understanding of responsive layouts, improve component structure, and continue practicing advanced CSS techniques. I also want to start organizing my CSS in a more scalable way as projects become larger.
